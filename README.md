# Problem Solutions from Competitive Programming Platforms

This repository contains solutions to problems from various competitive programming platforms such as **VJudge**, **AtCoder**, and **Codeforces**. The purpose of this repository is to practice algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques commonly used in competitive programming.

## About the Platforms

- **VJudge**: A platform that integrates multiple online judges, allowing users to solve problems from various sites in one place.
- **AtCoder**: A Japanese-based competitive programming platform that provides regular contests and challenges of varying difficulty levels.
- **Codeforces**: One of the most popular platforms for competitive programming, offering regular contests and a large problem archive.

The solutions in this repository aim to demonstrate different problem-solving strategies, algorithms, and data structures used in competitive programming.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by programming language and platform. Each solution can be found in a folder corresponding to the platform and the language used.

## How to Contribute

If you'd like to contribute by adding more solutions or improving the repository, please feel free to open a **Pull Request**. To maintain consistency, follow these guidelines:

1. Organize solutions by **platform** and **language**.
2. Name the files using the problem number (e.g., `1001.cpp`, `1002.py`).
3. Include comments in the code to explain the logic when necessary.
4. Ensure the code is well-formatted and follows good programming practices.

Note: This repository is a personal project and is not officially affiliated with VJudge, AtCoder, or Codeforces. Each platform provides a unique set of challenges and is a great resource for learning and practicing programming. For more information on these platforms, visit the following links:
