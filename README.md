# Problem Solutions from Competitive Programming Platforms

This repository contains solutions to problems from various competitive programming platforms such as **AtCoder**, and **Codeforces**. The purpose of this repository is to practice algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques commonly used in competitive programming.

The solutions in this repository aim to demonstrate different problem-solving strategies, algorithms, and data structures used in competitive programming.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by programming language and platform. Each solution can be found in a folder corresponding to the platform and the language used.

## How to Contribute

If you'd like to contribute by adding more solutions or improving the repository, please feel free to open a **Pull Request**. To maintain consistency, follow these guidelines:

1. Organize solutions by **platform** and **number**.
2. Name the files using the platform name and number (e.g., `Codeforces-1001.cpp`, `AtCoder1002.py`).
3. Include comments in the code to explain the logic when necessary.
4. Ensure the code is well-formatted and follows good programming practices.

Note: This repository is a personal project and is not officially affiliated with online platforms. Each platform provides a unique set of challenges and is a great resource for learning and practicing programming.
